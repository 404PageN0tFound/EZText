# EZText
A text engine for Scratch Lab

I made a text engine that **only works for Scratch Lab**. You're probably wondering, if it's in Scratch Lab, why not just use the Animated Text extension? Well, my text engine is Animated Text but it's a bit more advanced. Like think of the whole extension in just two blocks.

# How to use

> Open Scratch Lab (Animated Text) using [this](https://lab.scratch.mit.edu/text/) link.
> Download the .sb3 file using [this](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1HGy3gfdjBSZwFm95zCBwV7VBo3Gx9vLM) link
> On Scratch Lab, click "Try it out" then at the top click "File", "Load from your computer" and select the file.
